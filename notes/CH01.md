/* Frickin' great!  I can't leave notes in the watermarked PDF.  Preview keeps making a copy but
that act corrupts the copy.  I'm going to have to go all old-school here and drop my notes
externally.  Yuk! */

? He kicks off talking about JVM, ClassLoaders, and the external SecurityManager.  I haven't heard
about that thing in 10 years.  Does anyone still do this?

P2, Para 1:  "...Injection attacks (...XSS, XPath, LDAP injection) are possible when the components
susceptible to these attacks are used in the application"

CH01 is about
1. Dealing with sensitive data
2. Avoiding common injection attacks
3. Language features that can be misued to compromise security
4. Details of Java's fine-grained security mechanism

## 1.  Limit the lifetime of sensitive data

"Has memory pages that can be swapped out to disk...", "Holds sensitive data in a buffer (such as
BufferedReader)...",  "Reveals sensitive data in...environment variables..."

/* AHH!  I do almost all of this.  I thought environment variables would be preferable to the "put
the password in a .properties file" approach.  Why not?
*/

/* Console.readPassword() is the big reveal here.  The whole first pitch has something to do with
interned Strings and an array of chars[] is more under my control?
*/

## 2. Do not store unencrypted sensitive information on the client side.
